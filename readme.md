## 🧠 Inspired by

This project is heavily inspired by [Mark Macneil's Devfolio Template](https://mmacneil.github.io/devfolio/) and [Ryan FitzGerald Template](https://ryanfitzgerald.github.io/devportfolio/#), adapted and reimagined to reflect my personal style, my Tailwind evolving skill and general Tecnhologic stack.
